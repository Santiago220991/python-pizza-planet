## Getting started

You will need the following general tools:

- A Python interpreter installed. [3.9.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3913/) is preffered.

- A text editor: preferably [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

- Extensions such as [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) and [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

## Running the backend project

- Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Santiago220991/python-pizza-planet.git
```

- Create, activate a virtual environment, and install dependencies of the project:

```bash
make create-venv
```

- Start the database (Only needed for the first run):

```bash
make db-start
```

- If you want to seed the database: 

```bash
make db-seed
```

- If for any reason you need to delete de database:

```bash
make db-delete
```

- Run the project with:

```bash
make start-app
```

## Running the frontend

- Clone git UI submodule

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

- Install Live Server extension if you don't have it from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) on VSCode Quick Open (`Ctrl + P`)

```bash
ext install ritwickdey.LiveServer
```

- To run the frontend, start `ui/index.html` file with Live Server (Right click `Open with Live Server`)

- **Important Note** You have to open vscode in the root folder of the project.

- **To avoid CORS errors** start the backend before the frontend, some browsers have CORS issues otherwise

### Testing the backend

- Make sure that you have `pytest` installed

- Run the test command

```bash
make run-tests
```
